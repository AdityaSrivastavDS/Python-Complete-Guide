    "Imagine you have different animals—like a dog, a cat, and a bird—and they all can make a sound. Now, if you ask each of these animals to make a sound, they will each do it in their own way. Polymorphism is like saying, \"Hey, make a sound!\" to each of these animals without worrying about what kind of animal they are. Even though they're different, they all understand the command to make a sound, and they do it in their unique wa•y.\r\n",

    "♦Overriding:- This happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined and provided by its superclass. It means replacing the method in the superclass with a new implementation in the subclass. The signature (method name, parameters) remains the same, but the behavior can be different in the subclass. This allows for more specialized behavior in the subclass while still maintaining the same method name and structure.\n",
